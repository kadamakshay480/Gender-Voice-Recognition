# Gender-Voice-Recognition


The "Gender-Voice-Recognition using CNN" project aims to create a system that can determine the gender of a speaker based on their voice. It involves collecting voice datasets, preprocessing audio features like MFCCs, training a CNN model to learn gender patterns from these features, and evaluating its performance. Once trained, the model can be deployed for real-world gender recognition tasks, with continuous monitoring for updates and improvements.
